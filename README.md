 Speed Mapping progs (SMP) by dumptruck_ds

 This is a simple progs.dat file intended for use as a base for community speed
 mapping events. It's a modified version of the id1 progs except for
 quality-of-life features or traditional bug fixes mentioned in smp_readme.txt

 INSTALLATION:

 Use this like any other Quake mod by unzipping the "smp" folder into your Quake
 directory. Then launch Quake with the -game parameter on the command line.

 e.g c:\quake -game smp

 The fgd file is the same as the default included with TrenchBroom release
 2021.1 with an added spawnflag for "trigger spawned" monsters and other small
 changes. The source code is included.
