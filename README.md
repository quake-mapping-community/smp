 Speed Mapping progs (SMP)
 Version 2021.1 by dumptruck_ds

 This is a simple progs.dat file intended for use as a base for speedmapping
 events. It's a modified version of the id1 progs except for the following
 features or fixes:

 INSTALLATION:

 Use this like any other Quake mod by unzipping the "smp" folder into your Quake
 directory. Then launch Quake with the -game parameter on the command line.

 e.g C:\Quake -game smp

 2021/4/8
 * Fixed fish count bug (monsters.qc)
 * Fixed fish collision timing (fish.qc)
 * Fixed door unlock sound (doors.qc)
 * Added Preach's monster teleporting flag
     (spawnflag 8 to trigger spawn a targeted monster)
 * Added "trigger spawn" spawnflag to smp.fgd

 The fgd file is the same as the default included with TrenchBroom with an added
 spawnflag for "trigger spawned" monsters. The source code is included.
