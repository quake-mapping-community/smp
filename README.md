 Speed Mapping progs (SMP)
 Version 2021.1 by dumptruck_ds

 This is a simple progs.dat file intended for use as a base for speedmapping
 events. It's a modified version of the id1 progs except for the following
 features or fixes:

 INSTALLATION:

 Use this like any other Quake mod by unzipping the "smp" folder into your Quake
 directory. Then launch Quake with the -game parameter on the command line.

 e.g c:\quake -game smp

 The fgd file is the same as the default included with TrenchBroom with an added
 spawnflag for "trigger spawned" monsters. The source code is included.
